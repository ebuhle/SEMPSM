\title{Critical Z-Values from an SEM Given a PSM Threshold}
\usage{
sem_z_crit(fit, data, psm_crit, level = "site", alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Object of class \code{stanfit} representing a fitted PSM SEM. Parameters 
\code{mu_b0}, \code{sigma_b0}, \code{b0_std}, and \code{b0_Z} must be monitored.}

\item{data}{The data list passed to \code{stan()} to estimate \code{fit}.}

\item{psm_crit}{PSM threshold in (0,1).}

\item{level}{Level of grouping at which to predict. Options are \code{"site"}
(site-specific interannual average, the default) or \code{"year"}
(include year-within-site residual variation).}

\item{alpha}{Confidence level.}
}
\value{
A list with elements \describe{ 
\item{\code{zeros}}{An iter x \emph{S} matrix, 
where \emph{S} is the number of sites in \code{fit}, containing posterior samples of 
the site-specific zeros of \emph{P(PSM | Z) - psm_crit} as a function of \emph{Z}.}
\item{\code{z_crit}}{Numeric vector of length \emph{S} containing site-specific critical
\emph{Z}-values.}
\item{\code{delta_z}}{Numeric vector of length \emph{S} containing differences between
\code{z_crit} and the \emph{alpha}-th posterior quantile of site-specific \emph{Z}.}
}
}
\description{
Find site-specific critical values of a single latent factor \emph{Z} in a fitted SEM 
corresponding to a given critical PSM risk, and differences between the critical values
and current values of \emph{Z}, for a specified confidence level.
}
\details{
\code{sem_z_crit} assumes \code{fit} represents a single-factor model in which 
\code{I_b0_Z == 1} (that is, the site-specific fitted intercept includes an effect of \emph{Z},
and that the estimate of that effect is generally positive. Currently 
\code{sem_z_crit} assumes sample-average precipitation conditions; this will be relaxed in
the future. Critical values of \emph{Z} are found by first solving for the site-specific
zero of \emph{P(PSM | Z, data) = 0} for each posterior sample, and then finding the 
\emph{(1 - alpha/(1 - F(0))} quantile of those sampled zeros for each site that correspond to
positive slopes, where \emph{F(0)} is the empirical CDF of the slope w.r.t. \emph{Z} 
evaluated at zero. This method is conservative; it guarantees that at least proportion 
\emph{alpha} of the posterior sample of curves (i.e., those with positive slopes) will be 
less than \code{psm_crit} for all \emph{Z < Z_crit}, but it requires that 
\emph{F(0) < 1 - alpha}. Otherwise an error will be returned. Differences between \emph{z_crit} 
and the \emph{alpha}-th posterior quantile of estimated site-specific \emph{Z} are also
calculated.
